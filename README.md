# Neural Network
Build a neural network with python from scratch to recognize handwriting with Mnist dataset.

1. nn.py: Using numpy to build a neural networks
   <br>  _who.txt and wih.txt are weights of neural networks, we can resuse these weights to predict._
2. keras_nn.py: Using keras to build a neural networks
   <br> _we also can save the model to resuse next time :)_
